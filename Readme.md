# Zero CRM

A test project allowing me to play around with [Zero](https://zero.rocicorp.dev/), using [Atomic CRM](https://github.com/marmelab/atomic-crm) as a basis (mostly for the database), and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

This project requires a local instance of Atomic CRM running, in order to connect to its database.
